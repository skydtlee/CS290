What to turn in
Submit the following two addresses on Canvas as text.

The address where we can access Node on Engineering Servers.
This will be an URL in the form of http://flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:YYYYLinks to an external site., where flipX should be flip1, flip2, or flip3, and YYYY is the port number you choose, for example, 5678.
After following all the steps,  once you go to view the webpage flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:YYYY, the page displays "MySQL results...", that means your link is working and the forever process is up.
A link to your GitHub repository
This repository should have at least 2 files (any file type or content works) added to it.
If you set your repository as public, everyone can access it.  If you set it as private, please add OSU-CS290-Tester as a collaborator (you do not need to wait for the response from the Collaborator) so TAs can use the tester account to check your repository for grading.
Any submissions that do not include the Flip server URL, GitHub repo URL, and/or do not add OSU-CS290-Tester as a collaborator, will receive a 1 point deduction.
